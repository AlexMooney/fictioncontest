						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/zodiacal.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">For the first month of Ricardo and Felicity&rsquo;s affair, they greeted one another at every stolen rendezvous with a kiss &ndash; a lengthy, ravenous kiss, Ricardo lapping and sucking at Felicity&rsquo;s mouth as if she were a giant cage-mounted water bottle and he were the world&rsquo;s thirstiest gerbil. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Molly Ringle, Seattle, WA</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="blurb"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he winner of the 2010 Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/30/bulwer-lytton-worlds-worst-writing" title="Bulwer-Lytton prize for bad writing goes to 'inappropriate' gerbil sentence">Molly Ringle</a> of Seattle, Washington. The author of one published and two soon-to-be-published novels, Molly Ringle only writes bad fiction when she fails at good fiction. She&rsquo;d rather not say how often this happens. She lives in Seattle with her family, and her vices include uncalled-for moments of sarcasm, excessive consumption of Nutella, and an unladylike avidity for the raunchy films of Mel Brooks.</p>
						<p class="blurb">Molly Ringle is the 28th grand prize winner of the contest that that began at San Jose State University in 1982. She is also the second consecutive Washingtonian to win the contest, last year&rsquo;s being <a href="2009win.html" title="2009 Bulwer Lytton Contest Winners">David McKenzie</a>.</p>
						
					<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Through the verdant plains of North Umbria walked Waylon Ogglethorpe and, as he walked, the clouds whispered his name, the birds of the air sang his praises, and the beasts of the fields from smallest to greatest said, &ldquo;There goes the most noble among men&rdquo; &ndash;  in other words, a typical stroll for a schizophrenic ventriloquist with delusions of grandeur. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Tom Wallace, Columbia, SC </span></li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The band of pre-humans departed the cave in search of solace from the omnipresent dangers found there knowing that it meant survival of their kind, though they probably didn&rsquo;t understand it intellectually since their brains were so small and undeveloped but fundamentally they understood that they didn&rsquo;t like big animals that ate them. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mike Mayfield, Austin, TX</span></li>

						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Vile Puns</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/firegrate.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">It was a risky production unlike any mounted prior on the Met stage, the orchestra first imitating the perpetually beating heart of a man walled-in while in pursuit of wine, and then a soprano singing the plaintive aria of a barely alive woman stuffed up a chimney as her ancestral home was destroyed; however, it certainly was Opera Poe. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Amy Torchinsky, Greensboro NC</span></span></li>

							<li><img src="images/icons/cowboyhat.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">He walked into the bar and bristled when all eyes fell upon him &ndash; perhaps because his build was so short and so wide, or maybe it was the odor that lingered about him from so many days and nights spent in the wilds, but it may just have been because no one had ever seen a porcupine in a bar before. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Linda Boatright, Omaha, NE</span></span></li>
						</ul>

							<li class="contest">Faintly silhouetted against the shadowy murk of a nameless Devonian sea, the Megalodont shark was unaware of trilobites foraging in the primordial ooze not far below, trilobites that unlike the shark&rsquo;s cartilaginous being would become part of the fossil record of an ancient seabed that would in time heave up, dry out and go through the crusher at the Marulan Cement Works somewhere north of Sydney, Australia. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; John Mackesy, Victoria, Australia</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Leaning back comfortably in a plush old chair, feet up, fingers laced behind his head, Tom Chambers inventoried his life and with a satisfied grin mused, &ldquo;Ah, marlin fishing off the coast of Majorca, a bronze star for that rescue mission in Jamir, the unmatched fragrance of pastries fresh out of the oven at Caf&eacute; Legrande, two sons who would make any father proud &hellip; I&rsquo;ve never done any of that.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Ernie Santilli, Drexel Hill PA</span></li>

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">As the under-appreciated autumn evening faded into yet another soft black velvet fall night, all creatures large and small had settled in except for one, Loupy, the Schipperke, whose job was to keep Anatoly, the night watchman, informed of all things pertaining to the property with her signature uninterrupted warning barks which at this very moment would not subside until her master explained, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anyone named Timmy and we don&rsquo;t have a well.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Karen Arutunoff, Tulsa, OK</span></li>
						</ul>

							<li class="contest">&ldquo;You ask me, &lsquo;Why did you do it, Charlie, I could&rsquo;ve been a contender?&rsquo; &ndash; I&rsquo;ll tell you why: you worked your fights in too close, taking blow after unnecessary blow; I knew you were going to end up punchdrunk and need money for a nurse, and you were never a contender, you were only a referee.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Charles Alworth, Port Aransas, TX</span></li>

							<li class="contest">Oneida Revere picked at her meal and stared dully across the table at the charismatic charlatan who had seduced her with the illusion of love and tarnished her family&rsquo;s sterling reputation; she was wise to his bent mind games and though it felt like a knife through her heart, she knew it was time to stick a fork in it and call it done &ndash; her days of spooning with Uri Geller were over. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Terri Daniel (Seattle, WA) and Craig Rieger (Concord, CA) </span></li>
