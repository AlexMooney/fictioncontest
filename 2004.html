							<li><img src="images/icons/umbrella.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">It was a stark and dormy night &ndash; the kind of Friday night in the dorm where wistful women/girls without dates ovulated pointlessly and dreamed of steamy sex with bad boy/men in the backseat of a Corvette &ndash; like the one on <em>Route 66</em>, only a different color, though the color was hard to determine because the TV show was in black and white &ndash; if only Corvettes had back seats. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; David Kay, Lake Charles, LA</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">It was a dark and stormy night &ndash; actually not all that dark, but more dusky or maybe cloudy, and to say &ldquo;stormy&rdquo; may be overstating things a bit, although the sidewalks were still wettish and smelled of ozone, and, truth be told, characterizing the time as night is a stretch as it was more in the late, late afternoon because I think <em>Oprah</em> was still on. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Gregory Snider, MD, Lexington, KY</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">It was another dork and Stormy Knight &ndash; after snapping the last of his palm dampened dollar bills into the frazzled elastic of her G string &ndash; sent him packing precisely three-eighths of a mile down Highway 20 to the spot where she&rsquo;d promised him a glorious glimpse of self-awareness, and where he would discover a slight depression in the asphalt and find himself quizzically contemplating the adjacent Department of Transportation sign that read simply: &ldquo;Dip in Road.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Rick Sutherland, Depoe Bay, OR</span></li>
						</ul>

							<li><img src="images/icons/magnifier.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Detective Micky Blarke arrived on the scene at 2:14 am, and gave his cigarette such a severe pull that rookie Paul Simmons swore the insides of the detective&rsquo;s cheeks touched, but the judge indicated that that amount of detail was not necessary in his testimony, and instructed the jury to disregard that statement. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Joe Polvino, Webster, NY</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The knife handle jutted from her chest like one of the plastic pop-up timers in a frozen turkey, but from the blood pooling around the wound, it was apparent that this bird wasn&rsquo;t done. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Alaine Sepulveda, Las Cruces, NM</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">He heard a bang, well not really a bang but more of a crash with metallic overtones of platinum-encrusted steel alloys, hammering against unyielding iron and iridium plates; or maybe it was the clash of huge nickel-zinc rods hitting molybdenum fused sheets of tantalum, then he felt a stab of pain and heard another bang, and wished, instead of using his extensive metallurgy skills to try and analyze the sound, he would have run like hell when he first saw the gun pointed at him. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Ken Loomes, Winnipeg, Manitoba</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Students often said that Dr. Storm&rsquo;s lectures were duller than dishwater, not the dishwater after a holiday meal with brightly colored vegetable bits and shimmering glosses of vinaigrette, but the dishwater after a Wednesday night macaroni dinner, when the cheese has disintegrated into slime and the macaroni has become mush clogging the drain. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Alaine Sepulveda, Las Cruces, NM</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Phoebe watched through the library window as the sun sank slowly in the west, glowing like a ball of molten butter; not the phony margarine kind of butter that left nothing but the taste of grease in your mouth, but the real kind that pumped up your cholesterol and gave you a coronary, when such heart-related musings forced her to glance down at Neville, determine from the blue coloring of his skin that he really was dead, and then pick up the telephone and say, &ldquo;Operator, I believe my husband is having a heart attack.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Fran Abram, Overland Park, KS</span></li>

						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">I first saw her from across the crowded dance floor, cedar I think, (as if I can reference a specie of wood planks at a glance) I just know it wasn&rsquo;t that yellowish basketball court wood, the type with the glossy veneer (now THAT, I could recognize), anyway, she had the refined elegance and demure fragility of a really old Princess Leia. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Scott McIlhany, Bellingham, WA</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The huge intergalactic cruiser &ndash; type 4843-56B, class PVT/X &ndash; which was the color of an unripe blood-grapefruit (a sort of orangey-green like the skin, not the deep fuchsia of the flesh in the middle) edged its way carefully between the navigation buoys, which flashed intermittently like a pair of warning lights outside of a fire house, except they were more of a pinky-red rather than a dirty yellow. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Rob Wyatt, Concord, NC</span></li>
