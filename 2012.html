						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Inspector Murphy stood up when he saw me, then looked down at the lifeless body, crumpled like a forlorn Snicker&rsquo;s candy wrapper, and after a knowing glance at Detective Wilson pointed to the darkening crimson pool spreading from the stiff&rsquo;s shattered noggin, and said, &ldquo;You settle it, Gibson; does that puddle look more like a duck or a cow?&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Carl Stich, Mariemont, Ohio</span></li>
						</ul>						
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The blood seeped out of the body like bad peach juice from a peach that had been left on one side so long the bottom became rotten while it still looked fine on the top but had started to attract fruit flies, and this had the same effect, but with regular flies, that is not say there weren&rsquo;t some fruit flies around because, after all, this was Miami. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Howard Eugene Whitright, Seal Beach, CA</span></li>
						</ul>			
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The smooth hand I was caressing felt as if it belonged to a Persian monk that had been rubbing moisturizing body oils on his fellow monks all day (but not in a gay way, come on, he&rsquo;s a monk for God&rsquo;s sake), when in all actuality the hand belonged to a body that I had just pulled out of the Potomac for forensic investigation. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Kevin Bruemmer, San Antonio, TX</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest"><em>Primum non nocere</em>, from the Latin for &ldquo;first, do no harm,&rdquo; one of the principal tenets of the Hippocratic oath taken by physicians, was far from David&rsquo;s mind (as he strode, sling in hand, to face Goliath) in part because Hippocrates was born about 100 years after David, in part because David wasn&rsquo;t even a physician, but mainly because David wanted to kill the sucker. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; David Larson, San Francisco, CA</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Purple Prose</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/purple.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">William, his senses roused by a warm fetid breeze, hoped it was an early spring&rsquo;s equinoxal thaw causing rivers to swell like the blood-engorged gumlines of gingivitis, loosening winter&rsquo;s plaque, exposing decay, and allowing the seasonal pot-pouris of Mother Nature&rsquo;s morning breath to permeate the surrounding ether, but then he awoke to the unrelenting waves of his wife&rsquo;s halitosis. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Guy Foisy, Orleans, Ontario</span></span></li>

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Chain-smoking as he stood in the amber glow of the street lamp, he gazed up at the brownstone wherein resided Bunny Morgan, and thought how like a bunny Bunny was, though he had read somewhere that rabbits were coprophages, which meant that they ate their own feces, which was really disgusting now that he thought about it, and nothing like Bunny, at least he hoped not, so on second thought Bunny wasn&rsquo;t like a bunny after all, but she still was pretty hot. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Emma DeZordi, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Their love began as a tailor, quickly measuring the nooks and crannies of their personalities, but it soon became the seamstress of subterfuge, each of them aware of the others lingual haberdashery: Mindy trying to create a perfectly suited garment to display in public and Stan only concerned with the inseam. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; D.

						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The real problem with the &ldquo;many universes&rdquo; interpretation of quantum mechanics is that if it&rsquo;s true, then somewhere, in some universe, anything you can possibly imagine has already happened, which means that somewhere, another version of me has already finished writing the rest of this science-fiction novel, so I&rsquo;m not feeling real inspired to do it myself. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Steve Lauducci, Bethlehem, PA</span></li>
						</ul>

						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Professor Lemieux had anticipated that his latest paper would be received with skepticism within the small, fractious circle of professional cosmologists, few of whom were prepared to accept his hypothesis that our universe had been created in a marijuana-induced industrial accident by insectoid aliens; nevertheless, he was stung when Hawking airily dismissed it as the Bug Bong Theory. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Alan Follett, Hercules, CA</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Milton&rsquo;s quest for the love of Ms. Bradley was a risk but no sorry trivial pursuit yet he hadn&rsquo;t a clue why she had a monopoly on his heart&rsquo;s desires &ndash; in fact, it boggled his mind and caused him great aggravation because, in his checkered and troubled careers, he had always scrabbled hard and it drove him bonkers that she considered life just a game. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Linda Boatright, Omaha, NE</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>

							<li><img src="images/icons/cowboyhat.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">They still talk about that fateful afternoon in Abilene, when Dancing Dan DuPre moonwalked through the doors of Fat Suzy&rsquo;s saloon, made a passable reverse-turn, pirouetted twice followed by a double box-step, somersaulted onto the bar, drew his twin silver-plated Colt-45s and put twelve bullets through the eyes of the McLuskey sextuplets, on account of them varmints burning down his ranch and lynching his prize steer. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Ted Downes, Cardiff, U.K.</span></span></li>
						</ul>

						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Many years have passed since the events related here, but I remember them almost as well as if I had really been there, because I think about them frequently, turning them over and over in my mind, changing the facts to make me into more of a hero than I actually might have been, had I been there to do half the things I claim I did. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Thor F.

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
