## Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest Fortune File ##

The [Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/) is an annual contest to create the worst opening line of an imaginary novel.  As the winners are invariably hilarious, I decided to collect all of them into a fortune file.

This version has all the winners on the website up to and including 2013.  As I add the 2014 results, I'll clean up the mess and try to automate the process more.

### Usage ###
Copy the contents of the `fiction` directory to your fortune file directory (e.g. `/usr/share/games/fortunes/`), then run `fortune fictioncontest | cowsay | lolcat` for best results.
