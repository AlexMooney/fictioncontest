						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/zodiacal.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Gerald began &ndash; but was interrupted by a piercing whistle which cost him ten percent of his hearing permanently, as it did everyone else in a ten-mile radius of the eruption, not that it mattered much because for them &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; meant the next ten minutes or so until buried by searing lava or suffocated by choking ash &ndash; to pee. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Jim Gleeson, Madison, WI</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="blurb"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he winner of the 2007 Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is Jim Gleeson, a 47-year-old media technician from Madison, Wisconsin. Purportedly splitting his time between living in Madison and living in his own head, Gleeson claims to be working on a self-help book for slackers, &ldquo;Self-Improvement Through Total Inactivity.&rdquo; 2007 is the silver anniversary of the Contest that began at San Jose State University in 1982, making Jim Gleeson the 25<sup>th</sup> grand prize winner.</p>
						
					<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The Barents sea heaved and churned like a tortured animal in pain, the howling wind tearing packets of icy green water from the shuddering crests of the waves, atomizing it into mist that was again laid flat by the growing fury of the storm as Kevin Tucker switched off the bedside light in his Tuba City, Arizona, single-wide trailer and by the time the phone woke him at 7:38, had pretty much blown itself out with no damage. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Scott Palmer, Klamath Falls, OR</span></li>
						</ul>
						
					<h3>Grand Panjandrum&rsquo;s Special Award</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/statue.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">LaVerne was undeniably underdressed for this frigid weather; her black, rain-soaked tank top offered no protection and seemed to cling to her torso out of sheer rage, while her tie-dyed boa scarf hung lifeless around her neck like a giant, exhausted, pipe cleaner recently discarded after near-criminal overuse by an obviously sadistic (and rather flamboyant) plumber. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Andrew Cavallari, Northfield, IL</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
					<h3>Winner: Adventure</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/pith-helmet.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">As the hippo&rsquo;s jaws clamped on Henry&rsquo;s body he noted the four huge teeth badly in need of a clean, preferably with one of those electric sonic toothbrushes, and he reflected that his name would be immortalized by his unusual death, since hippo killings are not a daily occurrence, at least not in the high street of Chipping Sodbury. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Tim Lafferty, Horsell, Woking, UK</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">&ldquo;This is no time for safety,&rdquo; Lance Steele thought to himself as he raced in hot pursuit of the evildoer through the cold night along the narrow road winding through the desolate twisting pass, the smell of burnt rubber rising from the macadam and the occasional spark bursting from the gravel heaved against the titanium guard rail, and he wished that he had remembered to turn the oven off, and that he were not on foot and wearing his new Florsheims. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; P.C. Burchard, San Diego, CA</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Miss Cardinal mused over the singularly decadent manner in which Master Hammond consumed the steak and kidney pie and was reminded of the practices of certain cannibalistic tribes with whom she had lived during her travels in Borneo, not New Guinea, although New Guinea is certainly nice this time of year, despite the fact steak and kidney pie is rarely served there, at least not the kind made from sheep or cows. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Brad R. Frazer, Boise, ID</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Agent 53986262.9 was strapped precariously to a giant Chinese firework, the fuse slowly shortening like a noodle getting slurped into someone&rsquo;s pursed lips, and although he knew he was running out of time and still had no plan for escape, all he could think of was the song about the Muffin Man and how the word &ldquo;polyurethane&rdquo; made it sound like the material was made out of multiple urethras. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Allison Kelly, Great Falls, VA</span></li>
						</ul>

						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Mary had a little lamb; its fleece was Polartec 200 (thanks to gene splicing, a diet of force-fed petrochemical supplements, and regular dips in an advanced surface fusion polymer), which had the fortunate side effect of rendering it inedible, unlike that other Mary&rsquo;s organic lamb which misbehaved at school and wound up in a lovely Moroccan stew with dried apricots and couscous. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Julie Jensen, Lodi, CA</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Out of a hole in the ground popped a bunny rabbit which had a long thick orange carrot between its teeth and a big splotch of mud on its back that had dried into a dirt clump the size of a tumor. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Veronica Perez, Palm Springs, FL</span></li>
						</ul>

							<li><img src="images/icons/magnifier.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">I&rsquo;d been tailing this guy for over an hour while he tried every trick in the book to lose me: going down side streets, doubling back, suddenly veering into shop doorways, jumping out again, crossing the street, looking for somewhere to make the drop, and I was going to be there when he did it because his disguise as a postman didn&rsquo;t have me fooled for a minute. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Bob Millar, H&auml;sselby, Sweden</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">She&rsquo;d been strangled with a rosary &ndash; not a run-of-the-mill rosary like you might get at a Catholic bookstore where Hail Marys are two for a quarter and indulgences are included on the back flap of the May issue of &ldquo;Nuns and Roses&rdquo; magazine, but a fancy heirloom rosary with pearls, rubies, and a solid gold cross, a rosary with attitude, the kind of rosary that said, &ldquo;Get your Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness butt off my front porch.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mark Schweizer, Hopkinsville, KY</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">What shocked Juliette as she entered the room was not that there was an escaped convict under her coverlet snuggling with her best teddy bear, but that there was a knife through his back, &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; she wondered out loud, steadying herself against the faux-taffeta wallpaper, &ldquo;would stab a teddy bear?&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Katie Alender, Studio City, CA</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Fantasy Fiction</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/blaze.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Lady Guinevere heard it distinctly, a sharp slap, as if a gauntlet had been thrown, and yet it was hardly plausible that she, perched delicately on the back of her cantering steed, should be challenged to ride faster, since protocol determined that Arthur should ride in front, then she, then Lancelot, for that was the order prescribed by Merlin, ever since he invented the carousel. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Celine Shinbutsu, Hino City, Tokyo, Japan</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Hiram had been a three-toed dragon, well on his way to a promotion to Imperial five-toed dragon, when he accidentally choked on the pink chiffon scarf of Princess Chloe&rsquo;s hat, and his coughing set the new oaken parapet, on the old stone bulwark, ablaze, thereby earning a demotion to Troll 3 &ndash; now his only responsibility was to keep billy goats off the bridge. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Michael L. VanBlaricum, Santa Barbara, CA</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">At Elvenheim there was great joy, in that the legendary Ring of the Nordlings had been retrieved from the evil Sudlings by the hero Bill Baggydrawers, who it must be said looked nothing like a hero, at least none I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and the Ring had once again been placed on the middle finger of the left hand of the Elvenking, who did rather resemble a king, even if his buck teeth made him look for all the world like a great rabbit. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Wayne McCoy, Gainesville Fl</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Historical Fiction</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/parchment.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Samson looked in the mirror and, when he saw what a fantastic haircut Delilah had given him, he went weak at the knees. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Neil Prowd, Charnwood, ACT, Australia</span></span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/purple.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Professor Radzinsky wove his fingers together in a tweed-like fabric, pinched his lips together like a blowfish, and began his lecture on simile and metaphor, which are, like, similar to one another, except that similes are almost always preceded by the word &ldquo;like&rdquo; while metaphors are more like words that make you think of something else beside what you are describing. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Wayne McCoy, Gainesville Fl</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The highway coiled up and around the mountain like a snake ready to strike because it was being harassed by one of those annoying guys on &ldquo;Animal Planet.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Brent Sheppard, Morganton, NC</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Marilyn&rsquo;s main feature was her mountainous breasts, with an associated sharp ravine of cleavage &ndash; the breasts not awesome like Everest, but like one of the Highland peaks near Balquhidder, where the notorious outlaw Rob Roy spent his last days. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; John O&rsquo;Byrne, Dublin, Ireland</span></li>
						</ul>						
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">There was a numbing chill in the air &ndash; harsher than a localized anesthetic, far less jarring than your average epidural, but still effective at creating that tingly sensation which often precludes a general lack of feeling in one&rsquo;s extremities or sometimes leads to uncontrollable drooling if administered within the confines of a dentist&rsquo;s chair. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Randy Wilson, New Albany, IN</span></li>
						</ul>					
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife, not even a sharp knife, but a dull one from that set of cheap knives you received as a wedding gift in a faux wooden block; the one you told yourself you&rsquo;d replace, but in the end, forgot about because your husband ran off with another man, that kind of knife. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Lisa Lindquist, Jackson, MI</span></li>
						</ul>					
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The inebriated sailor cast himself into the safe harbor of the diner, and once he had run aground in one of the orange Formica booths, without a nod of recognition or greeting brought the distracted waitress into the present by ordering in a voice both blustery and belligerent the vegetable soup, an unctuous amalgam of the kitchen&rsquo;s leftover odds and ends sunk in a sulfurous sea of brine. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Jack Mac&rsquo;Kie, Naples, Florida</span></li>
						</ul>					
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The car headlights were pale &ndash; like a struck match viewed through a piece of smoked glass which you think you remember using to watch a solar eclipse around the time Alison and the children were still living here, which would have been the year before you got the job at the all-night bakery, twenty humid summers ago &ndash; because the alternator was faulty. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Richard Preddy, London, England</span></li>
						</ul>					
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">His feelings for Lydia became a jumbled mess, like when the pen slips out of the hole on a Spirograph wheel, ruining the drawing you have been working on for hours, or possibly, the pen running out of ink during the process, snagging and tearing a hole in the 110# cover rated vellum of his heart. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Russell Wren, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</span></li>
						</ul>					
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">She had curves that just wouldn&rsquo;t quit, like on one of those car commercials where a stunt driver slides a sexy new sports car around hairpin turn after hairpin turn while some poor musician, down on his luck and having been forced to sell out his dream of superstardom for a lousy 30-second ad jingle, sings &ldquo;Zoom, zoom, zoom&rdquo; in the background. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Amber Dubois, Denver, CO</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Her hair was the color of old copper, not green with white streaks like you see on roofs and statues where birds have been messing, but the kind you find on dark pennies from back in the nineteen-forties or fifties after God knows how many thumbs have been rubbing Abe Lincoln&rsquo;s beard. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Michael A.

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The moon rose in the east, a thin, yellow sliver like a fingernail ripped off with a jagged edge that goes to the quick and hurts like the dickens, making Selena wince as she looked on from Dirk&rsquo;s strong embrace and, recalling the last time she clutched at something so hard she broke a nail, brooded as she remembered that tomorrow was her annual pap smear. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Kathleen Luisa, Falls Church, VA</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Karl awoke with a start, his heart pounding away like a drum, not a well mannered tympani such as one might hear in a Boston Pops rendition of &ldquo;Also Sprach Zarathustra&rdquo; but rather more like a snare drum in the hands of Terry Bozzio during the time when he was performing with Frank Zappa. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Christopher D Brunkhorst, Oxford, NJ</span></li>

						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">She clung to the memory of their love like those tiny bits of used tissues he always left in his pockets, which mostly ended up in the dryer lint basket although enough of them welded themselves to her favorite navy blue, polar fleece pullover, rendering it as permanently flawed and unappealing as his name tattooed on her butt. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Pamela Patchet Hamilton, Beaconsfield, Quebec, Canada</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Ruthanne felt as though she was frozen in time, staring into Steve&rsquo;s eyes, deep turquoise pools of Tidy-Bowl blue, reflecting back the deep passionate love that Ruthanne felt in her heart because Steve certainly didn&rsquo;t feel anything, being in a coma as he was, so what Ruthanne had reflected back to herself was what she herself felt, bouncing off Steve&rsquo;s eyes, because there was absolutely zip going on behind those eyes. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Linda Morgan, Manassas, VA</span></li>
