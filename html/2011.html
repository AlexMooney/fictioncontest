						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/zodiacal.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Cheryl&rsquo;s mind turned like the vanes of a wind-powered turbine, chopping her sparrow-like thoughts into bloody pieces that fell onto a growing pile of forgotten memories. 
								<span class="winnerid">&mdash; Sue Fondrie, Oshkosh, WI</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="blurb"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he winner of the 2011 Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is Sue Fondrie, an associate professor of Curriculum and Instruction at the <a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/home" title="University of Wisconsin Oshkosh">University of Wisconsin Oshkosh</a> who works groan-inducing wordplay into her teaching and administrative duties whenever possible.  Out of school, she introduces two members of the next generation to the mysteries of <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, and &ndash; of course &ndash; the art of the bad pun.</p>
						<p class="blurb">At 26 words, Prof. Fondrie&rsquo;s submission is the shortest grand prize winner in Contest history, proving that bad writing need not be prolix, or even very wordy.</p>
						
					<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">As I stood among the ransacked ruin that had been my home, surveying the aftermath of the senseless horrors and atrocities that had been perpetrated on my family and everything I hold dear, I swore to myself that no matter where I had to go, no matter what I had to do or endure, I would find the man who did this &hellip; and when I did, when I did, oh, there would be words. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Rodney Reed, Ooltewah, TN</span></li>
						</ul>
						
					<h3>Winner: Adventure</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/pith-helmet.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">From the limbs of ancient live oaks moccasins hung like fat black sausages &ndash; which are sometimes called boudin noir, black pudding or blood pudding, though why anyone would refer to a sausage as pudding is hard to understand and it is even more difficult to divine why a person would knowingly eat something made from dried blood in the first place &ndash; but be that as it may, our tale is of voodoo and foul murder, not disgusting food. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Jack Barry, Shelby, NC</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Sensing somehow a scudding lay in the offing, Skipper Bob tallied his tasks: reef the mains&rsquo;l, mizzen, and jib, strike and brail the fores&rsquo;l, mizzen stays&rsquo;l and baggywrinkles, bowse the halyards, mainsheets, jacklines and vangs, turtle and belay fast the small cock, flemish the taffrail warps, batten the booby hatch, lay by his sou&rsquo;wester, and find the bailing bucket. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mike Mayfield, Austin, TX</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Crime</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/magnifier.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Wearily approaching the murder scene of Jeannie and Quentin Rose and needing to determine if this was the handiwork of the Scented Strangler &ndash; who had a twisted affinity for spraying his victims with his signature raspberry cologne &ndash; or that of a copycat, burnt-out insomniac detective Sonny Kirkland was sure of one thing: he&rsquo;d have to stop and smell the Roses. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mark Wisnewski, Flanders, NJ</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Five minutes before his scheduled execution, Kip found his thoughts turning to his childhood &ndash; all those years ago before he had become a contract killer whose secret weakness was a severe peanut allergy, even back before he lost half of a toe in a gardening accident while doing community service &ndash; but especially to Corinne, the pretty girl down the street whom he might have ended up marrying one day if she had only shown him a little more damn respect. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Andrew Baker, Highland Park, NJ</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mention:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The victim was a short man, with a face full of contradictions: amalgam, composite, dental porcelain, with both precious and non-precious metals all competing for space in a mouth that was open, bloody, terrifying, gaping, exposing a clean set of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth, but clearly the object of some very comprehensive dental care, thought Dirk Graply, world-famous womanizer, tough guy, detective, and former dentist. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Terri Daniel, Seattle, WA</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Historical Fiction</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The executioner sneered as the young queen ascended the stairs to the guillotine; in the old days, he thought, at least there was some buildup, a little time on the rack or some disemboweling, but nowadays everyone wants instant gratification. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Andrea Rossi, Wilmington, NC</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Purple Prose</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/purple.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">As his small boat scudded before a brisk breeze under a sapphire sky dappled with cerulean clouds with indigo bases, through cobalt seas that deepened to navy nearer the boat and faded to azure at the horizon, Ian was at a loss as to why he felt blue. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mike Pedersen, North Berwick, ME</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The Los Angeles morning was heavy with smog, the word being a portmanteau of smoke and fog, though in LA the pollutants are typically vehicular emissions as opposed to actual smoke and fog, unlike 19th-century London where the smoke from countless small coal fires often combined with fog off the Thames to produce true smog, though back then they were not clever enough to call it that. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Jack Barry, Shelby, NC</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">LaTrina &ndash; knowing he must live &ndash; let her hot, wet tongue slide slowly over Gladiator&rsquo;s injured ear, the taste reminding her of the late June flavor of a snow chain that had been removed from a tire and left to rust on the garage floor without being rinsed off. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Betsy Replogle, Nichols Hills, OK</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>

						<div class="space"></div>	
						<ul class="pane-list">

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>	
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">She held my hand as if she were having a swollen barrel of fun which was off considering that my teeth were sitting on my bathroom cabinet (eight miles away, no less) and my elbow was peeling like a soggy coconut, the fine hairs of which were standing on edge in fear, as if the coconut had been reading &ldquo;Dracula.&rdquo; <span class="winnerid">&mdash; James Hearn, Canterbury, Kent, U.K.</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Romance</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/heart.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">As the dark and mysterious stranger approached, Angela bit her lip anxiously, hoping with every nerve, cell, and fiber of her being that this would be the one man who would understand &ndash; who would take her away from all this &ndash; and who would not just squeeze her boob and make a loud honking noise, as all the others had. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Ali Kawashima, Greensboro, NC </span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Deanna waited for him in a deliberate pose on the sailor-striped chaise lounge of the newly-remodeled Ramada, her bustier revealing the tops of her white breasts like eggs &ndash; eggs of the slightly undercooked, hard-boiled variety, showing a nascent jiggle with her apprehensive breath, eggs that were then peeled ever-so-carefully so as not to pierce the jellied, opaque albumen and unleash the longing, viscous yolk within &ndash; yes, she lay there, oblong and waiting to be deviled.<span class="winnerid">&mdash; Meredith K. Gray, Ithaca, NY</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">They called her The Cat, because she made love the way she fought, rolling rapidly across the floor in a big, blurry ball of shrieking hair, fury, and dander, which usually solicited a &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; and flung shoe from one of the neighbors, and left her exhilarated lover with serious patchy bald spots and the occasional nicked ear. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Lisa Kluber, San Francisco, CA </span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>	
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">She gazed smolderingly at the mysterious rider, his body cloaked in enough shining black leather to outfit an Italian furniture store, wrapped so tightly each muscle stood out like a flamboyant Mexican hairdresser at an Alabamian monster truck rally; and he met her gaze with an intensity that couldn&rsquo;t have been matched by even a starving junkyard dog in the meat aisle of a suburban supermarket. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Chris Kemp, Annapolis, MD</span></li>

							<li><img src="images/icons/firegrate.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Detective Kodiak plucked a single hair from the bearskin rug and at once understood the grisly nature of the crime: it had been a ferocious act, a real honey, the sort of thing that could polarize a community, so he padded quietly out the back to avoid a cub reporter waiting in the den. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Joe Wyatt, Amarillo, TX</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Monroe Mills&rsquo; innovative new fabric-dyeing technique was a huge improvement over stone-washing: denim apparel was soaked in color and cured in an 800-degree oven, and the company&rsquo;s valued young dye department supervisor was as skilled as they came; yes, no one could say Marilyn was a normal jean baker. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Marvin Veto, Greensboro, NC </span></li>

						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Dawn crept up like the panther on the gazelle, except it was light, not dark like a panther, and a panther, though quiet, could never be as silent as the light of dawn, so really the analogy doesn&rsquo;t hold up well, as cool as it sounds, but it still is a great way to begin a story; just not necessarily this particular one. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Warren Blair, Ashburn, VA</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">&ldquo;Bleeeck!&rdquo; nine-year-old prince Crawthula, lord of Undaria and heir to the vampire throne, cried as the lollypop, expertly wielded by his irksome sister, left a bright red gooey smear across his pale cheek, shattering the image of tranquility he was ineffectually trying to maintain in front of his undead ministers and beginning the tirade that resulted in them both being sent to coffin before the first human had been brought out to feast on. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Eric A.
