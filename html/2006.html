						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Getting the performance rating of highly successful, although clearly nothing to be ashamed of, left Blevins somewhat oddly dissatisfied, like when you realize, upon having the triage nurses greet your ambulance, that your underwear, as far as you can determine, is in pretty decent condition, but you&rsquo;ll, nonetheless, never pull through the surgery. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Jim Lubell, Mechanicsville, Maryland </span></li>

							<li class="contest">As diaphanous curlicues of tobacco smoke tumbled gracefully in the honky-tonk air &ndash; like double-jointed gymnasts from the spirit world &ndash; Buck was reminded of his lifelong dream of becoming a brilliant veterinary surgeon, a dream he&rsquo;d vacuum-packed to his heart since watching a crime show about a rash of unsolved tail dockings on the Isle of Man. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Leslie Muir, Atlanta, GA</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Withdrawing his hand from her knee, the English professor stormed, &ldquo;Ending a sentence with a preposition is the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put,&rdquo; although she had merely looked at his hand and asked, &ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo; in a sentence intended to end the proposition. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Carl C.

						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Ah, yes, it was a beautiful face with skin smoother than pumice and breath fresher than a twenty-five-day-old tuna sandwich stored for safe keeping in a Wichita schoolgirl&rsquo;s lunchbox, and I found myself beset, nay, overcome, with twin urges: to ravish her there and then on the cash register, or to slough off the skin of my calloused feet on the stubble of her chin. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Cathy Bannister, Kaleen, Canberra, Australia</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Houses dotted the landscape in the small village where Hans lived &hellip; somewhat resembling a Monet painting &hellip; although he wasn&rsquo;t really the father of pointillism &hellip; but since it did directly offshoot FROM impressionism, it would still be appropriate; plus, the fact his name was Hans, made it seem all the more in keeping with the overall theme. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mariann Simms, Wetumpka, AL </span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Her romance ended, not a quick separation but like the gradually fading white dot on one of those old black-and-white vacuum tube TVs when it&rsquo;s turned off; and she was glad, because she felt uneasy in his arms and required as many adjustments to the &ldquo;horizontal hold&rdquo; and &ldquo;vertical hold&rdquo; as when she would stay up late watching scary shows like &ldquo;Twilight Zone&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outer Limits&rdquo; long ago. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Charles Wells, Albuquereque, NM</span></li>

						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Gripping the handle of the knife carefully, Vanessa made a nervous incision in the body on the table, wondering vaguely if she was anywhere near the heart as the surgeon, her work-experience supervisor, flicked vaguely through the latest &ldquo;Who magazine&rdquo; that was placed over the head of the patient, and in taking a deep drag of her filtered 16-milligram noticed that, if the Oscars were anything to go by, orange was back in again. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Beth Worrall, Australia</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">I saw her from across the room and knew I had to meet her, not because of her ample bosom, or her full lips, or her beautiful creamy skin, or the way her hair was twisted into a nice tight bun, or the buttoned-up blouse that begged to be torn off her body, or the skirt that was perhaps a size too small, but because she was my kid&rsquo;s teacher and I was here for the parent-teacher conference. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Lori Yates, Kezier, OR </span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Hardly a day passed without poor Matilda looking back on her life and ruing that fateful day she decided that to cut her toenails with her father&rsquo;s scythe to make up that extra four minutes she had wasted listening to &ldquo;Muskrat Love&rdquo; by the Captain &amp; Tennille. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Stephen Farnsworth, Manchester, England</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
