					<h3 class="grandwinner">Winner</h3>
					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li><img src="images/icons/zodiacal.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">On reflection, Angela perceived that her relationship with Tom had always been rocky, not quite a roller-coaster ride but more like when the toilet-paper roll gets a little squashed so it hangs crooked and every time you pull some off you can hear the rest going bumpity-bumpity in its holder until you go nuts and push it back into shape, a degree of annoyance that Angela had now almost attained. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Rephah Berg, Oakland, CA</span></span></li>
					</ul>
						
					<p class="blurb"><span class="firstcharacter">P</span>roving once again that Tom Hanks is not the only illustrious person from Oakland, California, the winner of San Jose State University&rsquo;s 21st annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is Oakland resident Rephah Berg. With 25 years of editing experience, she also occupies herself by producing puzzles for newsstand magazines and what she calls &ldquo;bursts of wit&rdquo; for lapel buttons. In her spare time she also tends to plants and animals and does volunteer work with an agency for the visually impaired. Her first name is pronounced REE-fa and her last name rhymes with the final syllable of &ldquo;iceberg&rdquo; (which is conveniently spelled the same). In the musty world of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, also known as the Bad Writing or Dark and Stormy Night Contest, Ms. Berg qualifies as a recidivist or repeat offender, meaning that she has entered before. <a href="2001win.html" title="2001 Winners">Last year she won the Detective Category</a>.</p>

					</ul>						
					<div class="space"></div>
					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li class="contest">It was a warm, rank odor that hit Detective Swatworth&rsquo;s nostrils, breaking into components that seemed hauntingly familiar, reminiscent of dangerous deeds past, lighting up every wary fiber in his torso, warning him to be wary of what lay ahead, on guard, finger on the trigger, then relaxed again as he realized it was coming from his own armpit. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Duke Smith, Warren, OR</span></li>

					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li class="contest">Sheila was easy as opening a jar of pickles, not one closed by a man who has virility doubts and closes a jar so women and young boys get hernias opening it or at least the boys get them; although I heard about a woman who had a hiatal hernia so I guess women get them too but doctors don&rsquo;t ask them to cough unless their malpractice covers sexual deviance but a jar closed by some ninety-year-old whose grip on the jar as well as reality has slipped. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Warren T.

					</ul>
					<div class="space"></div>
					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li class="contest">As her tears blurred his receding figure into a ghostly memory, she realized how thoroughly he had broken her heart, like a steamroller grinding the shards of a perfume bottle into splintered, dusty oblivion, at least as much as one can &ldquo;break&rdquo; a squishy organ composed of 70% water by weight; heck, let&rsquo;s be honest, you can no more break a heart than you can perform an appendectomy with a spoon, which is perhaps a better analogy for her pain in the first place. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Phil Currier, Cambridge, MA</span></li>
					</ul>
					<div class="space"></div>
					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li class="contest">The tropical island rose abruptly from the jade-green sea like some ancient leviathan skimming the surface for krill and imperceptibly deflected the warm, spice-tinged trade winds that had once propelled Drake, Cook, and Chichester on their momentous voyages, but which made no difference whatsoever to Forbes MacVane as he stood shivering in the &ldquo;Windy City,&rdquo; waiting for his contact to alight from the EL. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Patrick Bomgardner, APO AE 09469</span></li>
					</ul>

						<li><img src="images/icons/difference.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">It was a dark and silent night in Pluto, a planet nobody had ever taken seriously because of its name, which reminded us of the funny cartoon dog, and it being so far from the sun and having no atmosphere, which seemed unimportant as it was, obviously, lifeless &ndash; we thought &ndash; in those happy and carefree days when all the world had to worry about was war, famine, pestilence, and death. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Anna Rotenberg, Sao Paulo, Brazil</span></span></li>
					</ul>
						
					<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li class="contest">The controls looked normal &ndash; the beeping thing was beeping, the humming thing was humming, the blue number display was displaying blue numbers, the yellow number display was displaying yellow numbers, everything seemed OK, but the redundancy of this interplanetary trip left Col. Mountain feeling troubled, troubled like a beeping thing not beeping, or a humming thing not humming, or a blue number display not displaying blue numbers, or a yellow number display not displaying yellow numbers; nothing felt right. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Kevin Kriss, Cedar Park, TX</span></li>
					</ul>
						
					<h3>Dishonorable Mention:</h3>
					<ul class="pane-list">
						<li class="contest">It had started off as a prank, but when Major Elyse Livesay discovered (during her solo space walk, no less!) the tarantula that the boys in the crew had slipped into her spacesuit, she knew that while in space no one could hear you scream, it was damn sure not for lack of trying. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Matthew Chambers, Hambleton, WV</span></li>
