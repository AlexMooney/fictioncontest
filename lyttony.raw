								<p class="contest">Theirs was a New York love, a checkered taxi ride burning rubber, and like the city, their passion was open 24/7, steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm, moist breath through manhole covers stamped &ldquo;Forged by DeLaney Bros., Piscataway, N.

								<p class="contest">&ldquo;Ace, watch your head!&rdquo; hissed Wanda urgently, yet somehow provocatively, through red, full, sensuous lips, but he couldn&rsquo;t you know, since nobody can actually watch more than part of his nose or a little cheek or lips if he really tries, but he appreciated her warning. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Janice Estey, Aspen, CO</span></p></li>
