							<li><img src="images/icons/zodiacal.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">They had but one last remaining night together, so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange probably being a bland Cheddar and the white &hellip; Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn&rsquo;t taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Ms. Mariann Simms, Wetumpka, AL</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="blurb"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he wife of an Air Force retiree, the mother of an eight-year-old daughter and a fifteen-year-old herpetologist son, and the doting owner of an Australian Bearded Dragon, Mariann Simms of Wetumpka, Alabama, is the winner of this year&rsquo;s Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. When not stroking the beard of her Pogona vitticeps, she gardens, cooks, and runs an online interactive humor site, <a href="http://humormeonline.com/" title="HumorMeOnline">HumorMeOnline.com</a>. Like Tony Soprano, a native of New Jersey, she has lived in Alabama since her husband was stationed there thirteen years ago. Besides becoming a household name, she will receive the contest&rsquo;s traditional prize, a pittance.</p>
						
					<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The flock of geese flew overhead in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation &ndash; not in an old-fashioned-looking Times New Roman kind of a &ldquo;V&rdquo;, branched out slightly at the two opposite arms at the top of the &ldquo;V&rdquo;, nor in a more modern-looking, straight and crisp, linear Arial sort of &ldquo;V&rdquo; (although since they were flying, Arial might have been appropriate), but in a slightly asymmetric, tilting off-to-one-side sort of italicized Courier New-like &ldquo;V&rdquo; &ndash; and LaFonte knew that he was just the type of man to know the difference. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; John Dotson (U.S. Naval Officer), Arlington, VA</span></li>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/pith-helmet.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">It wasn&rsquo;t the desolate remoteness of the campsite that bothered him, or even the terrifying roar of the rapids beating themselves against solid granite below, so much as the eerie sound of pigs squealing in the distance and the fact that, in this light, cousin Billy looked disturbingly like Ned Beatty. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Cindy Erickson Gilman, Mission Viejo, CA</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">On the fourth day of his exploration of the Amazon, Byron climbed out of his inner tube, checked the latest news on his personal digital assistant (hereafter PDA) outfitted with wireless technology, and realized that the gnawing he felt in his stomach was not fear &ndash; no, he was not afraid, rather elated &ndash; nor was it tension &ndash; no, he was actually rather relaxed &ndash; so it was in all probability a parasite. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Chuck Keelan &amp; Stern Stewart, New York</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Children&rsquo;s Literature</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/mousehole.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">The Prince looked down at the motionless form of Sleeping Beauty, wondering how her supple lips would feel against his own and contemplating whether or not an Altoid was strong enough to stand up against the kind of morning breath only a hundred year&rsquo;s nap could create. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Lynne Sella, Susanville, CA</span></span></li>

							<li class="contest">They say she carried her own warmth around with her, like one of those thermoregulating arctic mammals, say, a polar bear, or a baby harp seal (though not a penguin, which is antarctic, anyway, and not a mammal, but a bird), but she wasn&rsquo;t fat or blubbery, which makes it all the more unbelievable why anyone would have wanted to club her to death for her fur coat, which wasn&rsquo;t even white, I&rsquo;m told, but black. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Harry H. Buerkett, Urbana, IL</span></li>
						</ul>

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Had Dorothy known Duncan was a psychopath who would seduce, then brutally murder her, and that her best friend Dana, a forensic pathologist would investigate her death and also fall in love with him, but be saved just in time by Dwayne, her much maligned colleague, perhaps she wouldn&rsquo;t have bought him that Screwdriver. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Karen Clark, Barkers Creek, Victoria, Australia</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">He knew that, at most, he had five seconds left to live, one one-thousand, two one-thousand, the gun barrel pointing at his face like a scolding finger, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, the hired assassin Ricardo&rsquo;s grip tightening on the trigger, five white elephants SIX white elephants, and then a bright blast of light as he wondered which was really the most accurate way to count five seconds. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Vincent M. Zito, Monroe, CT</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">I&rsquo;d stumbled onto solving my first murder case, having found myself the only eyewitness, yet no matter how frantically I pleaded with John Law that the perp was right in front of them and the very dame they&rsquo;d been grilling &ndash; the sultry but devious Miss Kitwinkle, who played the grieving patsy the way a concert pianist player plays a piano &ndash; the cops just kept smiling and stuffing crackers in my beak. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Chris Esco, Miami, FL</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The sobering scene was laid out before Detective Robinson like a centerfold spread in <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> or <em>Martha Stewart Living</em>, if the splayed bodies could be considered home furnishings such as hand-knotted 100% wool Tibetan area rugs or allergy-free hypodown throw pillows stuffed with European goose down and the blood on the walls had been a carefully spattered burnt vermillion latex paint for a classic aged or contemporary Jackson Pollock-like finish. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Theresa Olin, Nineveh, NY</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Winner: Purple Prose</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li><img src="images/icons/purple.png" class="floatleft" alt="#" title="#"><span class="contest">Raul strode through the dark night, his way lit by twinkling stars as if the gods at some celestial concert were all flicking their lighters at the same time in appreciation of the drum solo-like beat of his boot heels against the pavement, occasionally accompanied by the steel-brush-on-a-cymbal sound of a splash as he kicked through a puddle, the plip-plop of water dripping from leaves like someone playing staccato on a two-note piano gone flat, and the wind blowing a bluesy tissue-paper-on-comb harmonica through the trees. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Dot Young, Garland, TX</span></span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Runner-Up:</h3>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">There was no question about it, my computer was locked up like a crazy aunt in a dark, secluded attic, or like the brakes on my &lsquo;73 Chevy Impala on a rainy day when my wife is driving the kids to origami lessons and is running late because Isaiah, my son, made a fuss at the last minute and refused to be put into his car seat. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Peter L.

						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dishonorable Mentions:</h3>

						</ul>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">The rhythmic breathing of my companion was interrupted violently by a fit of coughing, causing the peace of the early morning to be ripped from me as if Richard Simmons had charged into my bedroom in his be-sequined health fervor and started Sweating to the Oldies on the end of my bed. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; A.

						<ul class="pane-list">
							<li class="contest">Anton was attracted to Angela like a moth to a flame &ndash; not just any moth, but one of the giant silk moths of the genus Hyalophora, perhaps Hyalophora euryalus, whose great red-brown wings with white basal and postmedian lines flap almost languorously until one ignites in the flame, fanning the conflagration to ever greater heights until burning down to the hirsute thorax and abdomen, the fat-laden contents of which provide a satisfying sizzle to end the agony. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Andrew Emlen, Skamokawa, WA</span></li>
