A resident of Fargo, North Dakota, McKay is currently visiting China, perhaps to escape notoriety for his dubious literary achievement. His entry, extolling a subject that has engaged poets for millennia, may have been inspired by Roxie Hart of the musical &ldquo;Chicago.&rdquo; Complaining of her husband&rsquo;s ineptitude in the boudoir, Roxie laments, &ldquo;Amos was &hellip; zero. I mean, he made love to me like he was fixing a carburetor or something.&rdquo;</p>

							<li class="contest">Charles stuck his head out the window, not fully realizing that the salt air and warm breeze would have no beneficial effect on a head severed and shrunk in Borneo and sold on a stick to tourists in Bali, and with little thought of the irony of the former missionary&rsquo;s vacant gaze on a nude beach with at least two couples in the missionary position. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; Mark D.

							<li class="contest">Anyone with a less refined air of unabashed insouciance would not have been able to so easily slip through the security cordon, charm their way past the armed guards, breeze through the marbled reception area and blithely enter the inner sanctum of the UN Security Council and there successfully negotiate an end to all conflict in the Middle East, but that was the sort of man Nigel Simpkins was. <span class="winnerid">&mdash; David Lindley, Sheffield, England</span></li>
